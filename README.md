# EURO-2020-Playmaker-Analysis
Stars Of EURO 2020!!

In this Project, I try to derive some insights about the playmakers of EURO 2020 from its Event Data obtained from fbref.com.
First, I structure the data in a jupyter notebook and then present the playmaker analysis in a dashboard in Tableau.

Here is the link to my Tableau Dashboard : https://public.tableau.com/views/PlaymakersofEuro2020/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
